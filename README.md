Milestone #1 
# Ecommerce-Follow-Along.

Overview:
Key Features of the Project:

1. MERN Stack: The project will use MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js for development.
 
2. REST API Creation: Learn to build scalable APIs guided by mentors.
   
3. Authentication: Implement secure login and registration.
  
4. Database Schema Design: Create structured data models using MongoDB.
  
5. Backend Development: Develop server-side logic using Node.js and Express.
  
6. Frontend Development: Build the user interface with React.

7. e-commerce application: Its functionality, UI, front-end and back-end integration.

Overview of MERN Stack:

Full Form:

M: MongoDB – A NoSQL database used for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
 
E: Express.js – A lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js that simplifies building robust APIs and server-side logic.
     
R: React – A JavaScript library for building dynamic, interactive, and component-based user interfaces.
     
N: Node.js – A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server, enabling full-stack development using a single language.
     
A full-stack JavaScript framework for developing web applications.
Streamlined development with a single language (JavaScript) across front-end and back-end.

REST API Structure and Endpoints:

Learn to design APIs for user authentication, product management, and order handling.
APIs will communicate with the database and serve JSON responses.

Basics of Database Schema Design:

Learn to define and structure data relationships in MongoDB.

Role of Authentication in Web Applications:

Secure user verification for accessing protected resources (e.g., purchases, sensitive information).
